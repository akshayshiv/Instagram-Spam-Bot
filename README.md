# Instagram Spam Bot

This is a spam bot using `Selenium` Browser Automation and instagram to be able to send spam messages to a certain target. This only works with public accounts if you are using a temp account to spam with, but it works with any account you follow if you put your own accounts credentials in the username and password. I in no means intend for this bot to be used for harrassment and bullying purposes, just a harmless bot to spam comments on your friends' posts.
1. To run this on your machine run 
`pip install selenium` 
or 
`pip3 install selenium`
if you are in a Python3 environment. 
2. To run this, you also need to run it on Firefox, as the elements of Selenium we are using in this have been deprecated in Google Chrome. 
3. Install `geckodriver` on Firefox to get it up and running. Have Fun!
